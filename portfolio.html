                      <p>
                        The ITS applet is an application extension of the ITS system. It serves to offer students and staff alike functionality that digitalises services currently based on paper and cards 
                        i.e. student and staff cards, proof of registration, examination time table.<br>
                        Below is a sample of the QR quote used by the student to get anything online regarding school.
                        e.g proof of registration,academic record,exam dates,student cards etc.

                        I am a graduate from Tshwane University Of Technology.I have specialised in software development,
                        and also have been involved in a couple of projects at school.As groups we were asked to develop a
                        certain project.We had to work together as we all didn't have any experience about web or mobile applications.
                        So we had to watch videos online and learn on our own.We managed to do a functioning beautiful system at the
                        end, even though we had a lot of challenges.We still allowed ourselves to explore and learn new things.
